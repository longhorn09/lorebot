# lorebot
Lorebot is a Discord bot written in JS to support a text-based RPG called [Arctic](http://mud.arctic.org).  
The bot will respond to commands prefixed by the prefix '!' specified in config.json.  
The original Lorebot was written in 2003 for IRC by Troggs and subsequently ported to Skype.  
Lorebot will also capture lores pasted in Discord chat, either singly or pasted in bulk.  
Lorebot was developed on Ubuntu Linux and is intended to run on Linux, however it can run on Windows.

## Adding Lorebot

## Dependencies

sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install nodejs
sudo apt-get install npm

# MySQL 8 database required
wget -c https://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql-apt-config_0.8.16-1_all.deb
sudo dpkg -i mysql-apt-config_0.8.16-1_all.deb
sudo apt-cache policy mysql-server
sudo apt-get install mysql-server

npm install moment

# For ES6+ functionality, primarily used for string.padEnd()

npm install
```

## Run Lorebot as a service

The following will daemonize lorebot.  
This will allow lorebot to continue running even after logging off the terminal.  
It's not required to run lorebot, but highly recommended. 

```bash
sudo npm install -g forever
forever start lorebot.js
```
## Loading the SQL database

Lorebot uses MySQL on the backend.   
Currently lorebot has over 5,800 lores.   
The easiest way to populate the Lorebot database with lores is to run the following SQL script:  

```./lorebot/sql/load_lorebot_db.sql```

from Linux bash shell

```mysql -u YOUR_USERNAME_HERE -p Lorebot < load_lorebot_db.sql```

The SQL script will populate the `Person` and `Lore` tables.      
You may still need to load the stored procedures as well.  
Relevant scripts for stored procedures can be found in `./lorebot/sql/`

## Permissions and Authentication

Your MySQL username and password that Lorebot uses to query MySQL will be setup in your config.json  
To lookup your various permissions you'll want to visit [https://discordapp.com/developers/applications](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications)

```json
{
  "prefix":"!",
  "token":"discord_token_here" ,
  "ownerID":"discord_client_id_here",
  "password":"mysql_password_here",
  "username":"mysql_username_here",
  "database":"Lorebot",
  "channel": "lorebot"
}
```

You'll want to make sure your MySQL privileges correspond with whatever you set in config.json   
Within MySQL:

```
CREATE USER 'mysql_username_here'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'mysql_password_here';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON Lorebot.* TO 'mysql_username_here'@'%';
```

## Bulk loading lores from a text file

For lores accumulated in a plain text file, Lorebot has a utility [load_lores.js](https://github.com/longhorn09/lorebot/blob/master/utility/load_lores.js) to facilitate loading lores into Lorebot.  
Currently the specified lore text file to load is hard-coded near the bottom in [load_lores.js](https://github.com/longhorn09/lorebot/blob/master/utility/load_lores.js) and can be tweaked to suit your needs.  
```const INPUT_FILE = path.join(__dirname,'lores_2016_wipe.txt');```  
This utility will load lores directly from a text file into the MySQL database and bypass Discord parsing.  

## Examples
```
!brief bronze.shield
!stat bronze.shield
```
![Discord Lorebot](/lorebot.PNG?raw=true "Example of brief and stat")


## Troubleshooting

There are typically 2 trouble spots. One is due to the way the SQL script is created, if loading the entire database from the script file, the MySQL database is expecting a user that doesn't exist. To rectify that, use the following

```
GRANT ALL ON *.* TO 'ntang'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'complex-password';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

The other trouble spot relates to the version of Node. The way to resolve this type of issue is to install and use node version manager (https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.8/install.sh | bash
```
